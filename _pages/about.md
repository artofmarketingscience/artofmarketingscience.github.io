	The Art of Marketing Science is a blog focused on applying data science in marketing, sharing from concepts to practical code for readers. Here we explore different ways to apply data science to marketing problems, think about marketing data, and implement various algorithms in Python & R. 
</p>

<p>

	Data science is widely applied in marketing as every company on this planet is looking to better understand their marketing efforts in hopes to reduce inefficiencies and maximize effectiveness but there is a lack of resources covering practical application of data science in marketing. This blog is geared towards data scientist currently working in marketing and marketing analysts looking to expand beyond traditional analytics.

<h5>The Author</h5>

<p>
	My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fongjason23/">Jason Fong</a> (more popularly referred to as <b>fongmanfong</b>) and I am a Data Scientist focused on solving marketing problems. Currently I am heading up Growth Algorithms at <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/">Wealthsimple</a>, a Toronto based Fintech start up. Previously I lead the Marketing Data Science team at <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>, an e-commerence platform. 
</p>

<p>
	My job is pretty straightforward: help marketing make more data informed decisions to reduce cost of acquisition and increase revenue for Shopify. How do I do this with my team? Well that is not so straightforward. We're working on things like:

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Building and productionizing an algorithmic (moving beyond just heuristic based) attribution model</li>
	<li>Media Mix Modelling to complement multi-touch attribution model</li>
	<li>Geo Experimentation to understand causal impact of marketing campaigns</li>
	<li>Building a state-of-the-art data infrastructure with scalable data pipelines to produce high quality datasets </li>
	<li>Statistical Modelling & Machine Learning (churn, LTV, propensity, lead scoring etc)</li>
	<li>A/B testing and experiments</li>
	<li>Causal inference and regression modelling to understand what levers move the needle</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Marketing is a complex domain and I'm just scratching the surface. My hope is that readers will learn something from this blog and I can connect with other folks working in this domain space.
</p>

<p> 
	I'm also one of the co-founders at <a href="https://www.mudaven.com">MUDAVEN</a>, where we take a technology first approach to real estate. We help real estate agents with creating 3D virtual tours, modern web design, digital marketing and more.
