	The Art of Marketing Science is a blog dedicated to the topic of applied data science in marketing. Here we explore different ways of looking at marketing problems through the lense of data science as well as demonstrate examples with code included.

<p>
	In addition, this blog includes a `Data Sandbox` section that serves as a personal data science playground for me. You'll find a variety of topics in this topic including tutorials, examples, random data thoughts and rants.
