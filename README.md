# About The Art of Marketing Science
The Art of Marketing Science is a blog focused on applying data science in marketing, sharing from concepts to practical code for readers. Here we explore different ways to apply data science to marketing problems, think about marketing data, and implement various algorithms in Python & R.

Data science is widely applied in marketing as every company on this planet is looking to better understand their marketing efforts in hopes to reduce inefficiencies and maximize effectiveness but there is a lack of resources covering practical application of data science in marketing. This blog is geared towards data scientist currently working in marketing and marketing analysts looking to expand beyond traditional analytics.
