        <title>From Marketing Analytics To Marketing Science</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes in the technology landscape in the past two decades have evolved the marketing industry as a whole, creating an entirely new field called digital marketing. First the dot com and internet boom, followed by an explosion of web data, and finally creation of cheap and readily available web analytics tools, digital marketers have much more insight into how their marketing campaigns are performing. Still which this much data and tools, marketers still have trouble answer this question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-12-10-from_marketing_analytics_to_marketing_science/christian_bale_idk.webp&quot; alt=&quot;jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web analytic tools like Google Analytics &amp;amp; Adobe Omniture has made marketing analytics a commodity and a marketer’s best friend. With a click of few button, marketers have the ability to see how many clicks, impression and even conversion their marketing campaigns have generated. They can see how their campaigns stack up against each other and overtime, turning marketing into a analytics and metrics driven profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-12-10-from_marketing_analytics_to_marketing_science/simon_gibson_math_gif.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since then, the move from purely analytics approach to more science-based has been slow. You probably now questioning what I mean by science vs analytics here so let’s take a quick moment to explain how I define the two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics approach&lt;/strong&gt; → Answering business questions by leveraging descriptive and predictive analytics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at the data overtime and identifying trends. Are things doing better or worse?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Segmenting / slicing &amp;amp; dicing the data to look at it from different perspectives. Are certain segments doing better or worse?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making decisions based on correlation between variables. When X moves, Y seems to move as well, so let’s do more of X.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the data to make predictions in the future. Will this person churn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science approach&lt;/strong&gt; → interpreting data and drawing inference with scientific rigor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attempting to find causality between variables, what’s causing what and at what magnitude&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at data in terms of estimate, probability, confidence interview, posterior distribution. I’m not sure what X is but I’m fairly it’s between Y and Z&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experimental design to prove/disprove hypothesis. Running randomized trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One science approach that marketing has adopted is experimental design in the form of A/B testing. Although widely used within marketing (and other areas), I’d argue a lot of the designed experiments implemented in many corporations are questionable. This will be a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that marketing analytics technology has matured enough and as marketers and data analyst, we should look at marketing from a scientific lens in additional to traditional analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;im-not-sure-if-i-understand-the-difference&quot;&gt;I’m Not Sure If I Understand The Difference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My explanation above might be too theoretical and high level. Let’s go through an example to better understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume Sally is a marketer and she does SEM for Company X. She sets up a new campaign targeting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Company X&lt;/code&gt; as the keyword. After a week she sees that her campaign received 100K impressions, 5000 clicks, 50 customers and spent a total of $500. The first question that needs to be answered is: “are the results good or bad”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would Sally go about answering this question? A general approach would be benchmark her new campaign with existing campaigns, comparing CPC and CAC. Let say she compares across several campaigns and on average CPC is around $0.20 and CAC is around $20, meaning her new campaign is 2x more efficient. This is great, seems like this campaign is killing it, let’s double down and spend more on this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is typically how marketing data is interpreted and actioned on. Marketers and data analyst looks at overall trends and make a decision based on insight drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the problem here? Well several key problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We never actually answered whether the campaign is performing well. We only looked at whether this campaign performed relatively well compared to historical aggregate of data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if all this campaign did was take from other campaigns?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the probability that the results we saw happened by chance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we should be interested in here instead is the incremental benefit of having this campaign to get a true sense of CAC. Sure the results might look great at face value but what if all it’s doing is taking away traffic from your Organic Search. Meaning these clicks would of been captured through Organic Search anyways. Actually in this case, the campaign is adding negative value since now Company X is paying for “free” traffic it would of gotten anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ok-so-how-can-i-be-more-scientific-with-marketing&quot;&gt;Ok, So How Can I Be More Scientific With Marketing?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one example (though very common) of using marketing analytics to drive “insights”. As seen, the problem with pure analytics approach is that we might not be answering the true question of interest. At best we may be making decisions based on signals that are highly correlated with the truth, at worst we are making decisions that are purely noise. Imagine if your company has a nine figure marketing budget, every decision becomes very expensive and critical to get right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-12-10-from_marketing_analytics_to_marketing_science/jon_stewart_cry.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can we answer this question? Methods and techniques to answer this question goes back to what this article is about, scientific approaches including experimental design and regression analysis can be used to help answer this question. I won’t go into too much detail in this introductory article (will in future articles) but designing a geo experiment or building a regression based model to understand the counterfactual are techniques that can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-mindset-shift&quot;&gt;A Mindset Shift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-12-10-from_marketing_analytics_to_marketing_science/think.webp&quot; alt=&quot;gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolving from marketing analytics to marketing science first requires a shift in mindset. We need to understand that more data does not mean more data informed decisions. We need to look at each problem and insight and critic it with rigor to determine if we are simply making inference on correlation or causation. I’m not saying that analytics is not useful to make decisions, far from that. Analytics provide a way to draw quick “insights” (better than just throwing darts in the dark). What I’m highlighting is the need to complement analytics with more science to make sure we’re hitting bullseye.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Regression Modelling Strategies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel very fortunate to work for an employer like Shopify, that places a lot of value in continuous learning and self development. One of the many benefits that we get as employees is an annual self-development budget that we can use on anything to level-up ourselves professionally. This year I decided to experiment with taking a 5 day short course on Regression Modelling Strategies offered at Vanderbilt University. This blog entry is a summary of sed course material, my experience and recommendations for other Data Scientists in the industry that might be interested in diving deeper into the topic of regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common way people tend to use their development budget is by attending conferences. I also know of some coworkers who have used their development budget over several years to pursue a formal University certification in Big Data / Data Science. Personally, I have mix feelings about both and I don’t find either one to fit my learning style very well. I’ve been to couple conferences related to data science and marketing but I felt I wasn’t able to take a whole lot away. Some felt way too product and sales focused while others lacked the content that I was looking for. The challenge that I have with some of these University Big Data certificate programs is the format of the education. Typically the format is a set of courses over several semesters and classes are mandatory on a weekly basis, with midterms, assignments, and exams. What I struggle with is the pace of the learning, I feel that it is too slow for me. I also dislike the breadth and lack of depth of the content. I feel like a lot of topics are usually covered in such programs but none are explored deeply. At this point of my career, I feel I have a better sense of what I know, what I don’t know, and what I want/need to know, which has consequently made me explore alternative options for my development budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing on Twitter ultimately led me to Frank Harrell’s RMS course. I was very intrigued by the concept of a condensed course that focused on a topic that I wanted to learn more about and thought was very relevant for my day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;course-summary&quot;&gt;Course Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course I took is called Regression Modelling Strategies, taught by Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/f2harrell?lang=en&quot;&gt;Frank Harrell&lt;/a&gt; at Vanderbilt University. This is a condensed version of the course that he regularly teaches during the semester. The course is broken up into 1 day (optional) R tutorial and 4 full days of course content. The course is intended for Masters and PhD level students, so there is an expectation that students already have a competent understanding of multiple regression modelling. The course becomes very challenging to follow along if students do not have that understanding or are not prepared for the lectures. For more information about the course, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/RmS&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of the course and Professor Frank Harrell can be summarized as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is more productive to make model fit step by step than to postulate a simple model and find out what went wrong&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carefully fitting improper model is better than badly fitting a well chosen one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good overall strategy is to decide how many degrees of freedom (regression parameters) can be “spent”, where they should be spent, and to spend them with no regrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics covered in the course include but not limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hypothesis Testing vs Estimation vs. Prediction vs. Classification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General Aspects of Fitting Regression Models
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Interpreting Model Parameters &amp;amp; Understanding Interactions&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Relaxing Linearity Assumptions for Continuous Predictors
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Non Linear Terms&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Splines for Estimating Shape of Regression Function&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Cubic / Restricted Cubic Splines / Choosing Number and Position of Knots&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Nonparametric Regression&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Assessment of Model Fit&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handling Missing Data
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strategies for Developing Imputation Model&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Predictive Mean Matching&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multivariable Modelling Strategies
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Variable Selection, Sample Size, Overfitting, Limit on Number of Predictors&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shrinkage&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Data Reduction Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describing, Resampling, Validating and Simplifying the Model
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Model Validation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bootstrap vs. Cross Validation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Binary Logistic Regression, Ordinal Logistic Regression, Survival Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case Studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed list of topics, &lt;a href=&quot;http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/RmS/rmsDescription.pdf&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-should-attend-this-course&quot;&gt;Who Should Attend This Course?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course description illustrates the target audience as “statisticians and related quantitative researchers who want to learn some general model development strategies, including approaches to missing data imputation, data reduction, model validation, and relaxing linearity assumptions”. In my opinion, I feel this topic / course is suitable for anyone who is working with data, primarily focusing on problems that require a good understanding of how variables interact with each other and affect outcome. My domain of interest is marketing and I am interested in answering questions such as, what levers affect churn or LTV, and at what magnitude? How does each marketing channel influence customer conversion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a traditional statistics course, with a focus on biostatistics, and not a machine learning / data science course. I don’t recommend this for anyone that is only interested in the prediction aspect of modelling and not the interpretation aspect. Although this is a biostatistics course, I think the content is relevant for people outside of the medical field as well. My class comprised of primarily doctors, postgraduate students, researchers or people from the medical industry, but there were also people from the finance sector, geology, etc. In my opinion, I actually think the biostatistics aspect of the course is beneficial and makes the course much more interesting. Surrounding yourself with people that are not in your field and looking at problems that you don’t look at on a day to day basis helps stimulate thoughts and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I highly recommend other people in the industry to take this course if they are interested in learning more about regression modelling and also have similar reservations towards conferences and long form education. I think there are couple things that can really help enhance this experience (from the perspective of someone coming from industry and not academia):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going as a team (4-5 people): Not only is this option more cost efficient, I think you can learn a lot more when you are studying as a group, by asking each other questions, sharing ideas and thoughts, challenging ideas etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being very prepared for the course so that you can have meaningful conversations with Professor Frank Harrell. There were several students that were taking the course for the 2nd or 3rd time and I noticed that they were able to have a deep conversations with the Professor about specific problems they are working on. There is a textbook that comes with this course, and I would highly encourage going over that material before attending the course as well during the course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Course improvements mentioned below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;improvements&quot;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is not perfect and there are definitely improvements that can be made. I’ve provided the same feedback on the course feedback survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The R tutorial is not necessary. I would prefer the R tutorial to be removed and allot an extra day for the course. The R content can be sent out prior to the course for students to review individually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a lack of interaction / collaboration amongst the students. I think having students from very diverse fields in one place is in itself a very valuable. The concept of having a mini group project intrigues me. Replacing the R tutorial day with extra half day of course content and half day of project presentation is also an intriguing idea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go deeper into survival analysis and ordinal regression&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Price for non institute members is fairly expensive and does not include airfare and accomodations, so that is something to consider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;takeaway&quot;&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very happy that I experimented with using my development budget on a short course. One thing to keep in mind is that you should not make the assumption that after a 5 day course you will know everything about regression modelling. That is simply impossible.  You will need to continue to self study but the course provides you with the foundation to continue exploring this topic further. I am currently still reading/re-reading the course textbook and course notes. At the same time I am reading academic papers that apply regression in the realm of marketing and I  find that I am able to understand the methodologies behind the modelling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts/comments/questions about my experience, feel free to reach out over &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fongmanfong&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or email. I would love to help address any questions or further share with you my experience. If you know of any other good short courses, please please please reach out. I would love to learn more about it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Remember Jack and Rose?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember Jack &amp;amp; Rose? Leo &amp;amp; Kate Winslet? Titanic movie? Nostalgia? I wish this project was half as romantic as the movie but I’d be lying to you if I said it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is the infamous Titanic dataset that all Kaggle newbs start out with. It is a classification problem where we need to predict if passengers will survive. Accuracy is used to evaluate predictions. At the time of submission, I was ranked 391/9642, top 4% on the leaderboard with an accuracy of 81.8%. By no means is this a perfect submission, nor did I write beautiful Python code. At the end, I have a section on considerations and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-01-27-project-kaggle_titanic/output_2_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t include all the analysis and code in this post, just the key areas of my analysis and prediction. If you want the detailed step by step, checkout my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fongmanfong/kaggle_competitions/blob/master/titanic/Titanic.ipynb&quot;&gt;GitHub here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#considerations&quot;&gt;Considerations / Improvements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the goal here is the predict whether passengers will survive this accident. For more information about this kaggle competition, you can checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic&quot;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic&lt;/a&gt;. A list of passenger information is broke into two datasets, training and test. The training set has information on whether a passenger survived while in the test set this information is hidden. We will use the training set to train our prediction model and apply onto the test set and kaggle will provide an accuracy score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information provided in the data sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PassengerID: ID of the passenger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Survived: If a passenger survived&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pclass: Ticket class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name: Passenger’s name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sex: Gender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Age: Age of passenger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SibSp: Number of siblings and/or spouses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parch: Number of parents and/or children&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ticket: Ticket number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fare: Dollar amount of ticket&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cabin: Cabin unit and number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Embarked: Boarding port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we’ll go through one feature at a time, exploring it, cleaning it if necessary and do feature engineering if it make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sex&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;sex&quot;&gt;Sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, we see from above Sex is a categorical variable so I’ll define a simple function map it to numerical values. It would be interesting to just see if there is a correlation between gender and survival. We see females has a significantly higher chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map_sex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embarked&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;embarked&quot;&gt;Embarked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We noticed that Embarked has one missing value in the training set. Since its a categorical, it would intuitively make sense that we can use the probability of the missing value being S, C, Q. We noticed that there is the highest chance of the missing value being S. Segmenting this by Survived, we see people Embarked = C is slightly correlated with survival rate vs S &amp;amp; Q&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Embarked&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;palette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Greens_d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name is a little more interesting. At face value, there are many different names but we see they all have a title. We know Mr. is different than Mrs. and we also see some interesting titles like Master. and Lady. Doing some research on Google we can see how these titles are used. We also notice that there are a lot of titles with similar meaning as well as titles that identify personnel with a different social class. We can group these titles together into intuitive categories to see if they have correlation with survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;extract_title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;extractall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'([A-Z]+[a-z]+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;.)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unstack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;palette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Greens_d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-01-27-project-kaggle_titanic/output_27_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mr.        240
Miss.       78
Mrs.        72
Master.     21
Col.         2
Rev.         2
Dona.        1
Dr.          1
Ms.          1
Name: Title, dtype: int64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to notice here is that Dona. is in test data but not the training set. We should include that in our categorization. Based on intuitive grouping, I’ve essentially classified all titles that are used for people with certain social class as Noble and anything else as Other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to gender, we see female titles Mrs. and Miss have strong correlation with survival. People with noble title tend to have a higher chance of surviving, which intuitively make sense. The so called “important” people tend to get favoured treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two variables give us information about the passengers family, (spouse, siblings, parents, children). The tricky part is we don’t really know if someone has a sibling or a spouse, similarly a parent or a child. We can probably take some time to infer, which may give us better insight into whether that person is a mother with certain number of child. This could be a good signal since we know mothers and children tend to be saved first in situations like Titanic. Given that blurb, in this exercise, I’ve kept it basic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see pasengers with one sibling or spouse have a slight correlation with survival. Similarly for passengers with 1 parent or child. One thing we can also look at is what both of these variables together tell us. Together will identify the family size of the passenger. We see more interesting results if we look at family. People with family size of 3 is highly correlated with surviving, while people with family size of 1 and 2 have a slight correlation with survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cabin&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cabin&quot;&gt;Cabin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen above, we noticed that there are a lot of missing data points for cabin. Although I just replace this information with unknown, I can probably do a better job of inferring what cabin person could be in. For example inferring which passengers belong to the same family and use knowledge that family prefer to stay close to each other. Maybe we can use name and see which members have the same last name, look at SibSP, Parch and Family size, are they in the same Pclass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cabin, I’m only interested in the first letter of the cabin. Reason being, the letter usually denotes the section of the cabin which implies different areas of the boat. Intuitively, even in the Titanic movie, people in different areas of the boat had different survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to notice here is that the test set does not have cabin T. As a result, any cabin room letters that are not in the test set I will set as U (for Unknown). The only case here is T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Cabin - Parsed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Cabin - Parsed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Cabin - Parsed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value_counts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tolist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'U'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ticket&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ticket&quot;&gt;Ticket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach that I’ve taken here is to look at the ticket label. Similar intuition as cabin, ticket label usually identify a certain type of ticket for certain types of passenger. Looking at the ticket values below, we see that there are a lot of clean up work to be done, like cleaning up empty spaces. I’ve made a simple assumption here that the periods are just noise. One hypothesis is that tickets were hand written back then so there could of been more variation to how tickets were labelled, like some people wrote A and some wrote A (period). Tickets with no identifier I’ve given it a no identifier label. Ticket labels with a / I’ve considered it to have two labels and introduced a label count variable.&lt;/p&gt;

Name: Ticket - First Label, dtype: int64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see a lot of ticket labels that appears very infrequently in our dataset and can be treated like outliers/noise. I’ve grouped all the ticket labels that appear less than ~3% of training set into the Other category to produce a ticket label that has a more representative sample size. A lot of levels in a categorical variable can throw off prediction accuracy. We see some interesting correlation between ticket label PC and surviving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;age&quot;&gt;Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age is probably the most interesting attribute here. We have around 150 missing records and we need to do something with them. One simple way of handling this is to simple populate it with a sample statistic like mean or median. This would lose a lot of information (~1/8 of the training set would be labeled with median / average age). Instead we can consider segmenting our data set to see if we can find more meaning ways of inferring age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, lets take a look if age has anything to do with survival rate. We saw that gender had a huge impact on survival, lets segment by Sex to see if female vs. male age distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FacetGrid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Sex'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Survived&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;margin_titles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Age&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;steelblue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;85&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x1156b4410&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-01-27-project-kaggle_titanic/output_61_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results are fairly intuitive, young to middle age male has the lowest chance of survival, while young to middle age women has the highest chance. This is one variable for our segmentation. Other variables I am considering are Title and Family size. Title make sense because a title like Miss vs Mrs sometimes can give you some indication of the age range of an individual. Family size also make sense because certain age groups tend to travel certain way. E.g people travelling individually tend to fall into a younger a group while people travelling with a family tend to fall into higher age group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because family size is a continuous variable, It would be easier to segment our data by labelling and converting it into a categorical variable. I’ve defined three labels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individuals (Family size = 0)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small Family (Family size between 1 and 3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big Family (Family size above 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like we expected, we see very different results based on our segmentation, which we would of missed if we simply replaced the missing values with a blanket sample statistic. A teenage girl travelling with family we would call her Miss and simultaneously a young professional female that’s not married travelling individually we would also call her Miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the segmentation, I take the median age in each group and build a lookup dictionary. Then I simply go through missing data in the training data and test data and fill in with the inferred age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;age_median_map&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fare&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fare&quot;&gt;Fare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fare only has one missing value in the training set so we can simply fill it with a sample statistic. I chose median here because average fare price can be thrown off by couple VIP super expensive tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Fare'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Fare'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;median&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;32.2042079686

&lt;p&gt;Alright now that we have cleaned up our features. We have a lot of extra columns when we were doing feature engineering and we won’t be using everything. Let’s only look at what we want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'PassengerId'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Pclass'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Sex'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'SibSp'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Parch'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; \
                      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Fare'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Embarked'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Family Size'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Individual'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; \
                      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Cabin - Parsed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Ticket - First Label'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Ticket Label Count'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;\
                      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Small Family'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Big Family'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Survived'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train_cleaned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because sklearn models doesn’t like categorical variables, we need to turn the categorical variables into individual binary vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Embarked'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Cabin - Parsed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Ticket - First Label'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Pclass'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train_cleaned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_dummies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train_cleaned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test_cleaned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_dummies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test_cleaned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;all_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train_cleaned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feature_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;all_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Survived'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Survived'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_train&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train_cleaned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;feature_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_train&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;train_cleaned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to go with tree based based classified for several, but not perfect, reasons. Firstly because tree classifiers provide out-of-the-box tool to identify feature importance based on information gain in the algorithm. This is handy as we can fine tune the model by eliminating not important features that could overfit our model. Secondly I specifically chose RandomForest for its robustness. This is not to say my reasonings are perfect, I should definitely take the time to explore additional models and benchmark it against each other to compare overall predictability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn.ensemble&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RandomForestClassifier&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn.feature_selection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SelectFromModel&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RandomForestClassifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n_estimators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first classifier is to understand the feature importance based on information gain. Using this information, I remove variables that has less than median importance between all features. Using the remaining features, I retrain the Random Forest Classifier. Using the GridSearch approach provided by sklearn, I do a 10 fold stratified cross validation with different model parameters to see which one gives back the highest accuracy score. This requires a lot of computational resource so I’ve kept the number of parameters to tune to a limited number. After pruning, we’re left with 18 features (~50%) for our Random Forest model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SelectFromModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prefit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'median'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_train_pruned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid_search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GridSearchCV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;param_grid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StratifiedKFold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n_splits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scoring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'accuracy'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the grid search and 10 fold cross validation, we see that setting a max depth of 9, considering 20% of all features when looking for best split, and 200 estimators in our Random Forest produces the best average accuracy score of 83.6%. Note that this score is not reflective of the actual score that you will get back from kaggle as cross validation is done on the training set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid_search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;best_score_&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.83613916947250277

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid_search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;best_params_&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{'max_depth': 9, 'max_features': 0.2, 'n_estimators': 200}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Survived'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid_search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'PassengerId'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Survived'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'titanic_prediction.csv'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;considerations--improvements&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;considerations&quot;&gt;Considerations / Improvements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in this post, the solution here is not perfect and there are many improvements and iterations that can be done on top of this to get a better score. There are a lot of people in this Kaggle competition that has a perfect score, which shows that there are ways to go with this solution. To summarize, if I had more time in the future, I would love to explore different improvements including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use different models including logistic regression, SVM, gradient boosting etc to see if I can get better results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding new and more useful features. E.g. is the passenger a parent?  does last name (representing family and social class) have an effect on survival?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use machine learning for filling in missing data like age. E.g. using KNN to find top X similar ppl to infer age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, ideas, questions, comments, feel free to shoot me a note and we can chat more!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marvel Cinematic Data Visualization With Plot.ly</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge sucker for Marvel cinematic and in this article I will do a fun exercise with building a simple interactive 3D network graph based on the relationship between Marvel characters. I will be using one of my favourite plotting libraries in Python, Plot.ly. Plot.ly is very easy to use and the way graphs are constructed is very intuitive. The dataset can be found on my GitHub or at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network&quot;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-and-exploring-the-data&quot;&gt;Setting up and exploring the data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;plotly.plotly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;plotly.graph_objs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;plotly.offline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key thing to remember with Plot.ly is if you want to build graphs locally on  you computer using Jupyter notebooks, you need to initiate offline notebook mode&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;init_notebook_mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hero-network.csv dataset contains two columns, hero1 and hero2 and represents a connection between the two characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero-network.csv'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero2&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;count&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;574467&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;574467&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;unique&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6211&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6173&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;top&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;CAPTAIN AMERICA&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;CAPTAIN AMERICA&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;freq&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8149&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8350&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some quick data cleaning to remove empty spaces&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rstrip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are playing around with the same code and want to explore additional characters, you can use the following line to explore what type of characters are included in the dataset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#heros[heros['hero1'].str.contains('DAREDEVIL')]['hero1'].unique()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this exercise, I’m interested in looking at the connection between some of the marvel characters and villains that we’ve see in theatres!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avengers_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'HULK/DR. ROBERT BRUC'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'BLACK WIDOW/NATASHA'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'CAPTAIN AMERICA'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                 &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'WAR MACHINE II/PARNE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'HAWKEYE | MUTANT X-V'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'FALCON/SAM WILSON'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                 &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'SCARLET WITCH/WANDA'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'VISION'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'ANT-MAN II/SCOTT HAR'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'SPIDER-MAN/PETER PAR'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                 &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;BLACK PANTHER/T'CHAL&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'DR. STRANGE/STEPHEN'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'THOR IV/DARGO'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'FURY, COL.

                 &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'QUICKSILVER/PIETRO M'&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;villain_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'BUCKY/BUCKY BARNES'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'MALEKITH/MALCOLM KEI'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'THANOS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'ULTRON'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'LOKI [ASGARDIAN]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'BARON MORDO/KARL MOR'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'DORMAMMU'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'RED SKULL/JOHANN SCH'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avengers_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;villain_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-lets-just-explore-the-avengers-social-circle&quot;&gt;First lets just explore The Avenger’s social circle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do a quick count on how many relationships each avengers have and how many comic books they appeared in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avenger_info&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'buddies'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avengers_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avenger_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avenger_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'buddies'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avenger_df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avenger_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'buddies'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'comics'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a grouped bar chart in Plotly is very simple. Each set of bar is treated as seperate data, we define the x and y values and the aesthetics for each group of bars. Then we define the layout like axes, chart title etc. Lastly we pass data and layout into Plot.ly’s figure function to build the graph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;buddies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avenger_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avenger_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'buddies'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'buddies'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;marker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'rgba(234, 35, 40, 1.0)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see our fellow Captain Steve Rogers is quite popular along with friendly neighborhood Spiderman and Mr. Tony Stark. One weird data point here is Thor who in my mind is should be quite popular… This might be because there are several Thor characters in the dataset, representing different Thors from different universes, as well as the comic book universe being different from cinematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;now-lets-build-the-network-graph-for-our-avengers-and-villains&quot;&gt;Now lets build the network graph for our Avengers and villains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, there are a whole lot of characters in our dataset, lets just keep our avengers and villains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'keep'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keep_avengers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'keep'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'keep'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reset_index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'index'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we use the igraph libary which is a library for high-performance graph generation and analysis. For more information on installation, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://igraph.org/python/&quot;&gt;http://igraph.org/python/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;igraph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ig&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the requirement to build this network graph is to express the source and destination nodes as integer values. So we start off with encoding our heros into numbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero2&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;SPIDER-MAN/PETER PAR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;HULK/DR. ROBERT BRUC&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;QUICKSILVER/PIETRO M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;SCARLET WITCH/WANDA&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;QUICKSILVER/PIETRO M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;IRON MAN/TONY STARK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Edges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;character_group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unique_heros&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num_unique_heros&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unique_heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num_unique_heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unique_heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero1_node'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero2_node'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero1_node&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;hero2_node&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;SPIDER-MAN/PETER PAR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;HULK/DR. ROBERT BRUC&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;QUICKSILVER/PIETRO M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;SCARLET WITCH/WANDA&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;QUICKSILVER/PIETRO M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;IRON MAN/TONY STARK&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I’d like to seperate our good guys from the bad guys visually, so let’s group them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unique_heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;character_group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avengers_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;character_group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now were ready to build our nodes and links. We start off with links by putting our (source, destination) for every node into Edges and pass Edges into our igraph. The layout function here defines the overall structure of our network graph and we use ‘sphere’. There are other options like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;gfr, grid_fr, grid_fruchterman_reingold: grid-based Fruchterman-Reingold layout&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;kk, kamada_kawai: Kamada-Kawai layout&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;kk_3d, kk3d, kamada_kawai_3d: 3D Kamada-Kawai layout&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play around with some of these to see the different structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Edges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero1_node'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'hero2_node'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Edges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;directed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'sphere'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part looks a little intimidating and complicated but its not so bad. Layout function helps us define the layout of the network graph, what we are doing here is populating our X, Y, Z coordinates for each node and edge to be placed into our 3D space&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dimension Reduction with Principal Component Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;PCA is one of the most popular techniques for dimensionality reduction. If you have no idea what I mean by dimensionality reduction, check out &lt;a href=&quot;./dimension-reduction-examples-part1&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this topic. In this article, we’ll explore PCA with a more applied approach rather than mathematical and we’ll keep certain details in a blackbox for future discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is PCA? PCA is an algorithm that transforms a dataset to lower dimensional dataset. The keyword here is transform which is different from feature selection that I’ve talked about in &lt;a href=&quot;./dimension-reduction-examples-part1&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;. The difference being that features are not removed from the dataset but instead the dataset itself is transformed. Simple hypothetical example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-05-01-dimension-reduction-pca/fig1.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have on the left the original dataset comprising of length, width, and height in centimetres. If we were to apply PCA to reduce this down to two dimensional dataset, we would get something like the right where we have two features, let say, Z1 and Z2. Z1 and Z2 is not produced from removing one of the features but instead all three features (L, W, H) are transformed and Z1 and Z2 does not represent the same measurements (cm) anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this algorithm is to reduce the dimensions of the dataset while retaining majority of the information, meaning maximizing the amount of variance kept. Another way of interpreting this is that the algorithm looks for vector(s) when projecting the data that minimizes the overall projection error. Lets take a look at what this means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-05-01-dimension-reduction-pca/fig2.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left we couple data points in 2D space that we hope to use PCA to reduce down to a one dimension vector. On the top right, we project the data onto the solid line. The dotted lines from the data point to the solid line is what we call the projection error. On the bottom right is another way of projecting the data onto another line. It is evident that the projection error of the bottom right graph is much bigger than the projection error of the top right. What is not as evident is that the variance of the projected data points on the line is much bigger for the top right graph vs. the bottom right. Whether it is to minimize projection error or maximize variance, PCA’s goal is to retain as much information about the dataset as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, one important step before applying this algorithm is to perform normalization on the mean and variance for each feature and scaling on the range. A feature (before scaling) with a disproportionately large variance will be tend to be favoured in PCA because to the algorithm this feature explains majority of the variance in the original dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a high level conceptual understanding of PCA, checkout the notebook belong on practical examples of how to apply PCA with sci-kit learn! I will illustrate two examples, one to highlight visually the results of PCA on a simple 2D &amp;amp; 3D dataset and another applying PCA on a high dimensional dataset. For the high dimensional datset, I will use the same dataset from Kaggle about food nutrients that I’ve used previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts&quot;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts&lt;/a&gt;
This data set has 134754 rows and 161 columns. One row per food product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn.decomposition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PCA&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;preprocessing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defined--of-principal-components&quot;&gt;Defined # of Principal Components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the iris dataset from sklearn to demonstrate visually how to apply PCA on a 2D dataset and reduce to 1D and a 3D dataset into 2D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iris&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load_iris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before applying PCA, we need to normalize our data to mean of 0 and unit variance. We can use the scale function in the preprocessing module from sklearn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d_scale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;preprocessing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Mean: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d_scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'[]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Standard Deviation: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d_scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'[]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mean:  -1.69031455e-15  -1.63702385e-15
Standard Deviation:  1.  1.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plotting the original and scaled data set. The two plot looks very similar because the range and variance of Sepal Length and Sepal Width are naturally similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_size_inches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add_subplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;121&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_xlabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Sepal Length - Original'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_ylabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Sepal Width - Original'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add_subplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;122&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d_scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[:,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d_scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[:,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_xlabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Sepal Length - Scaled'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_ylabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Sepal Width - Scaled'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;suptitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width (Original &amp;amp; Scaled)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-05-01-dimension-reduction-pca/fig3.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to reduce this dataset from 2D to 1D, using the PCA module from sklearn we specify to keep 1 component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pca&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PCA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n_components&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pca_2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pca&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fit_transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate more visually the results of PCA, lets take a look at reducing 3D dataset to 2D. Like previously, we first normalize our dataset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_3d_scale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;preprocessing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_3d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Mean: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_3d_scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'[]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solving-for-number-of-principal-components&quot;&gt;Solving For Number Of Principal Components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whats powerful about sklearn is that the same modules we used previously for PCA, under the circumstances that we don’t know the number of principal components prior to applying the reduction, can be used to solve for the number of principal components required to keep a certain % of variance within the dataset. Typically we want to retain 90%, 95% or 99% of the variance but depends on use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets use the same iris data as an example first then the food nutrient dataset from Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iris_3d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X_3d_scale&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the number of principal components, in the same PCA function, we define &lt;strong&gt;n_components&lt;/strong&gt; to be &lt;strong&gt;0 &amp;lt; n_components &amp;lt; 1&lt;/strong&gt; which is the % of variance that we want to keep in the dataset and we specify &lt;strong&gt;svd_solver == ‘full’&lt;/strong&gt;. Lets start with 95% then 30% and see what happens&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p_95&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PCA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n_components&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;svd_solver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'full'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen, we can reduce the 89 variables down to 11 components to keep 95% of the variance. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;explain_variance_ratio&lt;/code&gt; provides information on how much variance is kept for each component. The sum of it we can see is &amp;gt;95% which is the minimal we’ve defined. If we want more variance to be kept then # of components will increase and vice versa!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is dimensionality reduction? The name might sound fancier than what it actually is. It is simply the process of reducing the number of dimensions in a dataset aka reducing the number of attributes/features/columns while retaining key information in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-04-27-dimension-reduction-examples-part1/strange.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, but why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because more data does not necessarily mean we get better model performance. Many attributes could be noise to the key signals in a dataset (overfitting, curse of dimensionality).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data compression to reduce storage size, which reduces computational resource and helps speed up algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reducing data to 2D or 3D allows us to visualize the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two approaches to dimensionality reduction comprising different techniques/algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Selection&lt;/strong&gt; – selecting subset of feature in the dataset without transforming the dataset as a whole&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Extraction&lt;/strong&gt; – transforming the dataset into a lower dimensional space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For part 1 of dimensionality reduction, we’ll get started with applying three simple feature selection techniques using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore how to apply different dimension reduction techniques in Python, I will use a data set on food nutrient facts from Kaggle as an example. This data set has 134754 rows and 161 columns. One row per food product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts&quot;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;food_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'openfoodfacts.tsv'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(134754, 161)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;u'code'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;u'url'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;u'creator'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;u'created_t'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;u'created_datetime'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;missing-value-ratio&quot;&gt;Missing Value Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributes with a lot of missing values are not providing a lot of information. We can either impute the values for these attributes or remove from dataset. We compute the % of missing values and determine whether to drop the attribute or not. The threshold is up to you but roughly speaking an attribute with ~40-50% missing values could be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can leverage &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;isnull&lt;/code&gt; function from pandas dataframe to count how many empty fields are in each column. We can also leverage this information to calculate the % of missing values for each attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pct_missing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;missing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident there are significant number of attributes that barely have any information. Lets remove features that have less than 25% value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_food_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pct_missing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pct_missing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tolist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Index([u'code', u'url', u'creator', u'created_t', u'created_datetime',

&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-variance-filter&quot;&gt;Low Variance Filter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributes with very little change in its data, e.g. all values are 1s, also provides very little information. Similar to Missing Value Ratio, we remove attributes based on a define threshold of variance. Variance is range dependent therefore normalization is required and only applicable to numerical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to normalize each dimension as variance is range dependent. We can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MinMaxScaler&lt;/code&gt; function from sklearn preprocessing module to normalize value in each dimension to a value between 0 and 1. The challenge with this is that sklearn estimators does not handle NaN or missing values. An intermediate step is required to infer missing data with either mean or median or whatever statistics that would make most sense. There are different ways to do this like using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fillna()&lt;/code&gt; function in pandas or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Imputer&lt;/code&gt; module from sklearn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method we can simple define our own normalization function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;preprocessing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scaler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;preprocessing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MinMaxScaler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Extract numeric columns because cannot normalize and compute variance on categorical
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numeric_columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dtypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dtypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'float64'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the mean and variance, we could explore removing energy_100g, salt_100g sodium_100g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_food_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'energy_100g'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'salt_100g'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'sodium_100g'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;correlation-filter&quot;&gt;Correlation Filter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributes that are highly correlated tends to carry similar information, e.g. a company’s overall spend and its marketing spend. Because highly correlated attributes contain similar information, we can keep just one of these attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep this example simple, we will only look at the correlation between numeric variables. For categorical variables, there is an additional encoding step (covered in another blog article) that is required, which simply splits every categorical value of one dimension into individual columns with binary values of 1 or 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can build a correlation matrix using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;corr&lt;/code&gt; function in pandas. We could also use a more visual approach by using heatmap from seaborn library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;corr_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Extract numeric columns because cannot normalize and compute variance on categorical
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numeric_columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;corr_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dtypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;corr_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dtypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'float64'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_size_inches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heatmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;corr_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;corr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;annot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-04-27-dimension-reduction-examples-part1/output_30_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nutrition-score-fr_100g is highly correlated with nutrition-score-uk_100g&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fat_100g is pretty correlated with saturated-fat_100g&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nutrition-score-uk_100g is pretty correlated with fat_100g and saturated-fat_100g&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nutrition-score-fr_100g is pretty correlated with fat_100g and saturated-fat_100g&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sugars_100g is pretty correlated with carbohydrate_100g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets remove one of these attributes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_size_inches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;heatmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;corr_fil_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'nutrition-score-fr_100g'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'nutrition-score-uk_100g'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
         &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'fat_100g'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'sugars_100g'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;corr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;annot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017-04-27-dimension-reduction-examples-part1/output_32_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these three simple techniques for dimension reduction, we’ve reduce this dataset from 161 variables down to 49. Do keep in mind that the goal of dimension reduction is to remove attributes that are not very informative. More data does not necessarily mean better and at the same time less data does not necessarily mean better as well. The art is to find a set of attributes within a high dimension data set that will provide sufficient information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_food_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(134754, 49)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Intro To Python and Pandas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Python is one of the most popular and fastest growing software languages used in data analytics today and there are many reasons for that. I will cover majority of the topics in this blog in Python and occasionally R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are completely new to Python and programming, I encourage you to check out Codeacademy and do their free Python course. It’s important to get a good feel for this language and understand some fundamental concepts like syntax, libraries, data structures etc. The course is very straight forward and suitable for all level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pandas is a Python library (prewritten code for us to use) and is the bread &amp;amp; butter for data analysis. I’m assuming everyone that’s reading this used Excel or some sort of spreadsheet before. Pandas essentially stores data in a tabular format (rows and columns like a spreadsheet) with predefined functionalities to manipulate &amp;amp; analyze data. After learning about basic Python, I encourage you to check out this tutorial from Greg Reda on how to use pandas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series of blog articles, I will instead focus on this Panda’s cheatsheet and additional common functionalities, walking through some examples and relating to how you would use it on a day to day task. Lets start with creating Series an DataFrames, getting some data and removing some data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-series-and-dataframe&quot;&gt;Creating Series and DataFrame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets first define a Series. A Series is simply a one dimensional array, kind of like your Excel spreadsheet but with one column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;0    3
1   -5
2    7
3    4
dtype: int64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 0, 1, 2, 3 here is the index of the series. They are like the row #s in excel. We can also have predefined index labels for our Series. Lets label it a, b, c, d&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'d'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;a    3
b   -5
c    7
d    4
dtype: int64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataFrame on the other hand is like a Series but two dimensional, so like your full Excel sheet instead of one column. There are many ways to create a DataFrame with your data, its quite flexible and up to you what is the easiest based on the data set you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#if your data is already in dictionary form
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Country'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Belgium'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'India'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Brazil'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Capital'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Brussels'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'New Delhi'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Brasília'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Population'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;11190846&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1303171035&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;207847528&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Capital&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brussels&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11190846&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;New Delhi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1303171035&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brasília&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brazil&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;207847528&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could have some Series you already defined and want to put them together into a DataFrame. The NaN here means there is unknown value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'s1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'s2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;s1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;s2&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3.0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6.0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retrieving-data&quot;&gt;Retrieving Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember previously your Series by default is indexed by number (0,1,2,3) and you also labeled the index. You can get information either way, using index number or your label&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;3
3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataFrame is similar. Earlier we created a DataFrame with country information. We can get a column by specifying the column name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Country'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;0    Belgium
1      India
2     Brazil
Name: Country, dtype: object
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or multiple columns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Country'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Capital'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Capital&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brussels&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;New Delhi&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brazil&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brasília&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to select a range of rows, we use the : operator. It simply means select from this index value up to this index value. E.g. 0:2 means select row index 0 and 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Capital&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brussels&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11190846&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;New Delhi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1303171035&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deleting-data&quot;&gt;Deleting Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we dont need all the data in our DataFrame or Series. Pandas provide a very convenient way of removing the  data using the drop function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;b   -5
c    7
d    4
dtype: int64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'d'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;b   -5
c    7
dtype: int64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataFrame has an extra parameter that you need to specif, axis. Axis = 0 means you are looking to remove a row. Axis = 1 means you want to remove a column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Capital'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11190846&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1303171035&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brazil&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;207847528&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Capital&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brussels&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11190846&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very simple function in Python is the range function, which allows you to define a range of number range([start],[stop])&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0, 1]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Capital&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brasília&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brazil&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;207847528&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
